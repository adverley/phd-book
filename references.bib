  note        = {The ability to interact with deformable objects of any scale is a prerequisite for advanced robot autonomy. Depending on the size of the object, the development of these skills may involve all the degrees of freedom of one or more robotics systems, and even the mobility of an active platform. These skills are necessary in multiple fields, ranging from grasping and handling of everyday objects (food, clothing, etc.) in consumer robotics, surgical robotic procedures (manipulating tissues, guiding flexible needles, etc), picking up of agricultural products, or movement of large flexible objects (such as cables, ropes, and tents).However, taking into account deformation introduces new challenges, in particular:The complication of sensing deformationThe curse of infinite dimensionality of the deformation configurationThe complexity of high nonlinearity in modeling the deformationNew paradigms are needed to address these challenges. Therefore, the aim of this workshop is to discuss new research prospects considering the object's deformation in various robotic applications.We can sense deformation with different modalities, e.g. force/tactile measurements provide crucial information for grasping and manipulation, but, this feedback is only locally available. Vision, on the other hand, offers a global picture of shape deformation but is subjected to noise and occlusion. We seek Methods to robustly sense deformation; Compact feedback features for characterizing deformation to address the problem of infinite dimensionality;Exploiting environmental contacts for reducing the deformation dimensions, is another possible direction;Data-driven/model-based/hybrid approaches to model deformation for control,  to cope with the high nonlinearity problem.We propose this interactive workshop to present and discuss new perspectives in managing deformation as a step towards higher robot autonomy. The purpose of the workshop is to bring together researchers who have common interests in working with deformable objects in robotic applications. The previously-presented challenges and possible directions of research are not exhaustive. The organizers encourage participants to propose new challenges and solutions in the scope of managing deformation.},

  abstract  = {In the production of computer generated pictures of three dimensional objects, one stage of the calculation is the determination of the intensity of a given object once its visibility has been established. This is typically done by modelling the surface as a perfect diffuser, sometimes with a specular component added for the simulation of hilights. This paper presents a more accurate function for the generation of hilights which is based on some experimental measurements of how light reflects from real surfaces. It differs from previous models in that the intensity of the hilight changes with the direction of the light source. Also the position and shape of the hilights is somewhat different from that generated by simpler models. Finally, the hilight function generates different results when simulating metallic vs. nonmetallic surfaces. Many of the effects so generated are somewhat subtle and are apparent only during movie sequences. Some representative still frames from such movies are included.},

  abstract = { We use reinforcement learning (RL) to learn dexterous in-hand manipulation policies that can perform vision-based object reorientation on a physical Shadow Dexterous Hand. The training is performed in a simulated environment in which we randomize many of the physical properties of the system such as friction coefficients and an object’s appearance. Our policies transfer to the physical robot despite being trained entirely in simulation. Our method does not rely on any human demonstrations, but many behaviors found in human manipulation emerge naturally, including finger gaiting, multi-finger coordination, and the controlled use of gravity. Our results were obtained using the same distributed RL system that was used to train OpenAI Five. We also include a video of our results: https://youtu.be/jwSbzNHGflM. }

It is used to implement the matrix multiplication of a neural network to enhance the time performance of a text detection system. Preliminary results produced a 20-fold performance enhancement using an ATI RADEON 9700 PRO board. The parallelism of a GPU is fully utilized by accumulating a lot of input feature vectors and weight vectors, then converting the many inner-product operations into one matrix operation. Further research areas include benchmarking the performance with various hardware and GPU-aware learning algorithms.}

Application areas include robotic surgery, household robotics, manufacturing, logistics, and agriculture, to name a few. Related research problems span modeling and estimation of an object's shape, estimation of an object's material properties, such as elasticity and plasticity, object tracking and state estimation during manipulation, and manipulation planning and control. In this survey article, we start by providing a tutorial on foundational aspects of models of shape and shape dynamics. We then use this as the basis for a review of existing work on learning and estimation of these models and on motion planning and control to achieve desired deformations. We also discuss potential future lines of work.}

  abstract = {An important field in robotics is the optimization of controllers. Currently, robots are often treated as a black box in this optimization process, which is the reason why derivative-free optimization methods such as evolutionary algorithms or reinforcement learning are omnipresent. When gradient-based methods are used, models are kept small or rely on finite difference approximations for the Jacobian. This method quickly grows expensive with increasing numbers of parameters, such as found in deep learning. We propose the implementation of a modern physics engine, which can differentiate control parameters. This engine is implemented for both CPU and GPU. Firstly, this paper shows how such an engine speeds up the optimization process, even for small problems. Furthermore, it explains why this is an alternative approach to deep Q-learning, for using deep learning in robotics. Finally, we argue that this is a big step for deep learning in robotics, as it opens up new possibilities to optimize robots, both in hardware and software.}

  abstract   = {Designing real and virtual garments is becoming extremely demanding with rapidly changing
                fashion trends and increasing need for synthesizing realisticly dressed digital humans
                for various applications. This necessitates creating simple and effective workflows
                to facilitate authoring sewing patterns customized to garment and target body shapes
                to achieve desired looks. Traditional workflow involves a trial-and-error procedure
                wherein a mannequin is draped to judge the resultant folds and the sewing pattern
                iteratively adjusted until the desired look is achieved. This requires time and experience.
                Instead, we present a data-driven approach wherein the user directly indicates desired
                fold patterns simply by sketching while our system estimates corresponding garment
                and body shape parameters at interactive rates. The recovered parameters can then
                be further edited and the updated draped garment previewed. Technically, we achieve
                this via a novel shared shape space that allows the user to seamlessly specify desired
                characteristics across multimodal input without requiring to run garment simulation
                at design time. We evaluate our approach qualitatively via a user study and quantitatively
                against test datasets, and demonstrate how our system can generate a rich quality
                of on-body garments targeted for a range of body shapes while achieving desired fold
                characteristics. Code and data are available at our project webpage.},

  abstract = { The application of deep learning in robotics leads to very specific problems and research questions that are typically not addressed by the computer vision and machine learning communities. In this paper we discuss a number of robotics-specific learning, reasoning, and embodiment challenges for deep learning. We explain the need for better evaluation metrics, highlight the importance and unique challenges for deep robotic learning in simulation, and explore the spectrum between purely data-driven and model-driven approaches. We hope this paper provides a motivating overview of important research directions to overcome the current limitations, and helps to fulfill the promising potentials of deep learning in robotics. }

  abstract  = {We have seen much recent progress in rigid object manipulation, but interaction with deformable objects has notably lagged behind. Due to the large configuration space of deformable objects, solutions using traditional modelling approaches require significant engineering work. Perhaps then, bypassing the need for explicit modelling and instead learning the control in an end-to-end manner serves as a better approach? Despite the growing interest in the use of end-to-end robot learning approaches, only a small amount of work has focused on their applicability to deformable object manipulation. Moreover, due to the large amount of data needed to learn these end-to-end solutions, an emerging trend is to learn control policies in simulation and then transfer them over to the real world. To date, no work has explored whether it is possible to learn and transfer deformable object policies. We believe that if sim-to-real methods are to be employed further, then it should be possible to learn to interact with a wide variety of objects, and not only rigid objects. In this work, we use a combination of state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithms to solve the problem of manipulating deformable objects (specifically cloth). We evaluate our approach on three tasks—folding a towel up to a mark, folding a face towel diagonally, and draping a piece of cloth over a hanger. Our agents are fully trained in simulation with domain randomisation, and then successfully deployed in the real world without having seen any real deformable objects.}

  abstract      = {The detection and measurement of gas concentrations using the characteristic optical absorption of the gas species is important for both understanding and monitoring a variety of phenomena from industrial processes to environmental change. This study reviews the field, covering several individual gas detection techniques including non-dispersive infrared, spectrophotometry, tunable diode laser spectroscopy and photoacoustic spectroscopy. We present the basis for each technique, recent developments in methods and performance limitations. The technology available to support this field, in terms of key components such as light sources and gas cells, has advanced rapidly in recent years and we discuss these new developments. Finally, we present a performance comparison of different techniques, taking data reported over the preceding decade, and draw conclusions from this benchmarking.},

  abstract  = {We have seen much recent progress in rigid object manipulation, but interaction with deformable objects has notably lagged behind. Due to the large configuration space of deformable objects, solutions using traditional modelling approaches require significant engineering work. Perhaps then, bypassing the need for explicit modelling and instead learning the control in an end-to-end manner serves as a better approach? Despite the growing interest in the use of end-to-end robot learning approaches, only a small amount of work has focused on their applicability to deformable object manipulation. Moreover, due to the large amount of data needed to learn these end-to-end solutions, an emerging trend is to learn control policies in simulation and then transfer them over to the real world. To date, no work has explored whether it is possible to learn and transfer deformable object policies. We believe that if sim-to-real methods are to be employed further, then it should be possible to learn to interact with a wide variety of objects, and not only rigid objects. In this work, we use a combination of state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithms to solve the problem of manipulating deformable objects (specifically cloth). We evaluate our approach on three tasks—folding a towel up to a mark, folding a face towel diagonally, and draping a piece of cloth over a hanger. Our agents are fully trained in simulation with domain randomisation, and then successfully deployed in the real world without having seen any real deformable objects.}

  abstract = { We consider the problem of autonomous robotic laundry folding, and propose a solution to the perception and manipulation challenges inherent to the task. At the core of our approach is a quasi-static cloth model which allows us to neglect the complex dynamics of cloth under significant parts of the state space, allowing us to reason instead in terms of simple geometry. We present an algorithm which, given a 2D cloth polygon and a desired sequence of folds, outputs a motion plan for executing the corresponding manipulations, deemed g-folds, on a minimal number of robot grippers. We define parametrized fold sequences for four clothing categories: towels, pants, short-sleeved shirts, and long-sleeved shirts, each represented as polygons. We then devise a model-based optimization approach for visually inferring the class and pose of a spread-out or folded clothing article from a single image, such that the resulting polygon provides a parse suitable for these folding primitives. We test the manipulation and perception tasks individually, and combine them to implement an autonomous folding system on the Willow Garage PR2. This enables the PR2 to identify a clothing article spread out on a table, execute the computed folding sequence, and visually track its progress over successive folds. }

@article{Verleysen2020-folding,
  abstract  = {Deformable objects such as ropes, wires, and clothing are omnipresent in society and industry but are little researched in robotics research. This is due to the infinite amount of possible state configurations caused by the deformations of the deformable object. Engineered approaches try to cope with this by implementing highly complex operations in order to estimate the state of the deformable object. This complexity can be circumvented by utilizing learning-based approaches, such as reinforcement learning, which can deal with the intrinsic high-dimensional state space of deformable objects. However, the reward function in reinforcement learning needs to measure the state configuration of the highly deformable object. Vision-based reward functions are difficult to implement, given the high dimensionality of the state and complex dynamic behavior. In this work, we propose the consideration of concepts beyond vision and incorporate other modalities which can be extracted from deformable objects. By integrating tactile sensor cells into a textile piece, proprioceptive capabilities are gained that are valuable as they provide a reward function to a reinforcement learning agent. We demonstrate on a low-cost dual robotic arm setup that a physical agent can learn on a single CPU core to fold a rectangular patch of textile in the real world based on a learned reward function from tactile information.},

  abstract = {When a comparison between time series is required, measurement functions provide meaningful scores to characterize similarity between sequences. Quite often, time series appear warped in time, i.e, although they may exhibit amplitude and shape similarity, they appear dephased in time. The most common algorithm to overcome this challenge is the Dynamic Time Warping, which aligns each sequence prior establishing distance measurements. However, Dynamic Time Warping takes only into account amplitude similarity. A distance which characterizes the degree of time warping between two sequences can deliver new insights for applications where the timing factor is essential, such well-defined movements during sports or rehabilitation exercises. We propose a novel measurement called Time Alignment Measurement, which delivers similarity information on the temporal domain. We demonstrate the potential of our approach in measuring performance of time series alignment methodologies and in the characterization of synthetic and real time series data acquired during human movement.}

In modern manufacturing systems, data-driven machine health monitoring is gaining in popularity due to the widespread deployment of low-cost sensors and their connection to the Internet. Meanwhile, deep learning provides useful tools for processing and analyzing these big machinery data. The main purpose of this paper is to review and summarize the emerging research work of deep learning on machine health monitoring. After the brief introduction of deep learning techniques, the applications of deep learning in machine health monitoring systems are reviewed mainly from the following aspects: Auto-encoder (AE) and its variants, Restricted Boltzmann Machines and its variants including Deep Belief Network (DBN) and Deep Boltzmann Machines (DBM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). In addition, an experimental study on the performances of these approaches has been conducted, in which the data and code have been online. Finally, some new trends of DL-based machine health monitoring methods are discussed.}

  abstract = {Dataset size continues to increase and data are being collected from numerous applications. Because collecting labeled data is expensive and time consuming, the amount of unlabeled data is increasing. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has been proposed to improve conventional supervised learning methods by training from both unlabeled and labeled data. In contrast to classification problems, the estimation of labels for unlabeled data presents added uncertainty for regression problems. In this paper, a semi-supervised support vector regression (SS-SVR) method based on self-training is proposed. The proposed method addresses the uncertainty of the estimated labels for unlabeled data. To measure labeling uncertainty, the label distribution of the unlabeled data is estimated with two probabilistic local reconstruction (PLR) models. Then, the training data are generated by oversampling from the unlabeled data and their estimated label distribution. The sampling rate is different based on uncertainty. Finally, expected margin-based pattern selection (EMPS) is employed to reduce training complexity. We verify the proposed method with 30 regression datasets and a real-world problem: virtual metrology (VM) in semiconductor manufacturing. The experiment results show that the proposed method improves the accuracy by 8 compared with conventional supervised SVR, and the training time for the proposed method is 20 shorter than that of the benchmark methods.}

Since unreliable data can cause model parameters to deviate from the real distributions and make network structures unable to characterize the true causalities, data quality feature is utilized to improve the process modeling and monitoring performance. With a predetermined trustworthy center, the data quality measurement results can be evaluated through an exponential function with Mahalanobis distances. The conventional Bayesian network learning algorithms including structure learning and parameter learning are modified by the quality feature in a weighting form, intending to extract useful information and make a reasonable model. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through TE benchmark process and a real industrial process.}

More specifically, we discuss how this information can be cast into socially-inspired rewards for speeding up the policy optimisation for both efficient task completion and user adaptation in an online learning setting. For this purpose a potential-based reward shaping method is combined with a sample efficient reinforcement learning algorithm to offer a principled framework to cope with these potentially noisy interim rewards. The proposed scheme will greatly facilitate the system's development by allowing the designer to teach his system through explicit positive/negative feedbacks given as hints about task progress, in the early stage of training. At a later stage, the approach will be used as a way to ease the adaptation of the dialogue policy to specific user profiles. Experiments carried out using a state-of-the-art goal-oriented dialogue management framework, the Hidden Information State (HIS), support our claims in two configurations: firstly, with a user simulator in the tourist information domain (and thus simulated appraisals), and secondly, in the context of man–robot dialogue with real user trials.}

  abstract  = {We have seen much recent progress in rigid object manipulation, but interaction with deformable objects has notably lagged behind. Due to the large configuration space of deformable objects, solutions using traditional modelling approaches require significant engineering work. Perhaps then, bypassing the need for explicit modelling and instead learning the control in an end-to-end manner serves as a better approach? Despite the growing interest in the use of end-to-end robot learning approaches, only a small amount of work has focused on their applicability to deformable object manipulation. Moreover, due to the large amount of data needed to learn these end-to-end solutions, an emerging trend is to learn control policies in simulation and then transfer them over to the real world. To date, no work has explored whether it is possible to learn and transfer deformable object policies. We believe that if sim-to-real methods are to be employed further, then it should be possible to learn to interact with a wide variety of objects, and not only rigid objects. In this work, we use a combination of state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithms to solve the problem of manipulating deformable objects (specifically cloth). We evaluate our approach on three tasks—folding a towel up to a mark, folding a face towel diagonally, and draping a piece of cloth over a hanger. Our agents are fully trained in simulation with domain randomisation, and then successfully deployed in the real world without having seen any real deformable objects.}

  abstract = { We describe a learning-based approach to hand-eye coordination for robotic grasping from monocular images. To learn hand-eye coordination for grasping, we trained a large convolutional neural network to predict the probability that task-space motion of the gripper will result in successful grasps, using only monocular camera images independent of camera calibration or the current robot pose. This requires the network to observe the spatial relationship between the gripper and objects in the scene, thus learning hand-eye coordination. We then use this network to servo the gripper in real time to achieve successful grasps. We describe two large-scale experiments that we conducted on two separate robotic platforms. In the first experiment, about 800,000 grasp attempts were collected over the course of two months, using between 6 and 14 robotic manipulators at any given time, with differences in camera placement and gripper wear and tear. In the second experiment, we used a different robotic platform and 8 robots to collect a dataset consisting of over 900,000 grasp attempts. The second robotic platform was used to test transfer between robots, and the degree to which data from a different set of robots can be used to aid learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves effective real-time control, can successfully grasp novel objects, and corrects mistakes by continuous servoing. Our transfer experiment also illustrates that data from different robots can be combined to learn more reliable and effective grasping. }

  abstract = { We consider the problem of autonomous robotic laundry folding, and propose a solution to the perception and manipulation challenges inherent to the task. At the core of our approach is a quasi-static cloth model which allows us to neglect the complex dynamics of cloth under significant parts of the state space, allowing us to reason instead in terms of simple geometry. We present an algorithm which, given a 2D cloth polygon and a desired sequence of folds, outputs a motion plan for executing the corresponding manipulations, deemed g-folds, on a minimal number of robot grippers. We define parametrized fold sequences for four clothing categories: towels, pants, short-sleeved shirts, and long-sleeved shirts, each represented as polygons. We then devise a model-based optimization approach for visually inferring the class and pose of a spread-out or folded clothing article from a single image, such that the resulting polygon provides a parse suitable for these folding primitives. We test the manipulation and perception tasks individually, and combine them to implement an autonomous folding system on the Willow Garage PR2. This enables the PR2 to identify a clothing article spread out on a table, execute the computed folding sequence, and visually track its progress over successive folds. }

Therefore, it may be suitable to apply them for robots to learn and perform daily activities like washing and folding clothes, cooking, and cleaning since such tasks are difficult for non-DRL methods that often require either (1) direct access to state variables or (2) well-designed hand-engineered features extracted from sensory inputs. However, applying DRL to real robots remains very challenging because conventional DRL algorithms require a huge number of training samples for learning, which is arduous in real robots. To alleviate this dilemma, in this paper, we propose two sample efficient DRL algorithms: Deep P-Network (DPN) and Dueling Deep P-Network (DDPN). The core idea is to combine the nature of smooth policy update with the capability of automatic feature extraction in deep neural networks to enhance the sample efficiency and learning stability with fewer samples. The proposed methods were first investigated by a robot-arm reaching task in the simulation that compared previous DRL methods and applied to two real robotic cloth manipulation tasks: (1) flipping a handkerchief and (2) folding a t-shirt with a limited number of samples. All the results suggest that our method outperformed the previous DRL methods.}

  abstract  = {We have seen much recent progress in rigid object manipulation, but interaction with deformable objects has notably lagged behind. Due to the large configuration space of deformable objects, solutions using traditional modelling approaches require significant engineering work. Perhaps then, bypassing the need for explicit modelling and instead learning the control in an end-to-end manner serves as a better approach? Despite the growing interest in the use of end-to-end robot learning approaches, only a small amount of work has focused on their applicability to deformable object manipulation. Moreover, due to the large amount of data needed to learn these end-to-end solutions, an emerging trend is to learn control policies in simulation and then transfer them over to the real world. To date, no work has explored whether it is possible to learn and transfer deformable object policies. We believe that if sim-to-real methods are to be employed further, then it should be possible to learn to interact with a wide variety of objects, and not only rigid objects. In this work, we use a combination of state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithms to solve the problem of manipulating deformable objects (specifically cloth). We evaluate our approach on three tasks—folding a towel up to a mark, folding a face towel diagonally, and draping a piece of cloth over a hanger. Our agents are fully trained in simulation with domain randomisation, and then successfully deployed in the real world without having seen any real deformable objects.}

Optimizing the rate, reliability, and range of UP is difficult due to inherent uncertainty in sensing, control, and contact physics. This paper explores {\textquotedblleft}ambidextrous{\textquotedblright} robot grasping, where two or more heterogeneous grippers are used. We present Dexterity Network (Dex-Net) 4.0, a substantial extension to previous versions of Dex-Net that learns policies for a given set of grippers by training on synthetic datasets using domain randomization with analytic models of physics and geometry. We train policies for a parallel-jaw and a vacuum-based suction cup gripper on 5 million synthetic depth images, grasps, and rewards generated from heaps of three-dimensional objects. On a physical robot with two grippers, the Dex-Net 4.0 policy consistently clears bins of up to 25 novel objects with reliability greater than 95\% at a rate of more than 300 mean picks per hour.},

  abstract = { We describe a learning-based approach to hand-eye coordination for robotic grasping from monocular images. To learn hand-eye coordination for grasping, we trained a large convolutional neural network to predict the probability that task-space motion of the gripper will result in successful grasps, using only monocular camera images independent of camera calibration or the current robot pose. This requires the network to observe the spatial relationship between the gripper and objects in the scene, thus learning hand-eye coordination. We then use this network to servo the gripper in real time to achieve successful grasps. We describe two large-scale experiments that we conducted on two separate robotic platforms. In the first experiment, about 800,000 grasp attempts were collected over the course of two months, using between 6 and 14 robotic manipulators at any given time, with differences in camera placement and gripper wear and tear. In the second experiment, we used a different robotic platform and 8 robots to collect a dataset consisting of over 900,000 grasp attempts. The second robotic platform was used to test transfer between robots, and the degree to which data from a different set of robots can be used to aid learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves effective real-time control, can successfully grasp novel objects, and corrects mistakes by continuous servoing. Our transfer experiment also illustrates that data from different robots can be combined to learn more reliable and effective grasping. }

Participatory research approaches, in which researchers and communities are involved in all aspects of a research study, can improve study outcomes and foster greater data accessibility and utility as well as increase public transparency. Here we review varied concepts of participatory research, describe how it complements and overlaps with community engagement and environmental justice, examine its intersection with emerging environmental sensor technologies, and discuss the strengths and limitations of participatory research. Although participatory research includes methodological challenges, such as biases in data collection and data quality, it has been found to increase the relevance of research questions, result in better knowledge production, and impact health policies. Improved research partnerships among government agencies, academia, and communities can increase scientific rigor, build community capacity, and produce sustainable outcomes. }

While techno-optimists and techno-pessimists contest whether a jobless future is a positive development or not, this paper points to the elephant in the room. Despite successive waves of computerization (including advanced machine learning), jobs have not disappeared. And probably won’t in the near future. To explain why, some basic insights from organization studies can make a contribution. I propose the concept of ‘bounded automation’ to demonstrate how organizational forces mould the application of technology in the employment sector. If work does not vanish in the age of AI, then poorly paid jobs will most certainly proliferate, I argue. Finally, a case is made for the scholarly community to engage with wider social justice concerns. This I term public organization studies. }
