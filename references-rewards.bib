  abstract  = {We have seen much recent progress in rigid object manipulation, but interaction with deformable objects has notably lagged behind. Due to the large configuration space of deformable objects, solutions using traditional modelling approaches require significant engineering work. Perhaps then, bypassing the need for explicit modelling and instead learning the control in an end-to-end manner serves as a better approach? Despite the growing interest in the use of end-to-end robot learning approaches, only a small amount of work has focused on their applicability to deformable object manipulation. Moreover, due to the large amount of data needed to learn these end-to-end solutions, an emerging trend is to learn control policies in simulation and then transfer them over to the real world. To date, no work has explored whether it is possible to learn and transfer deformable object policies. We believe that if sim-to-real methods are to be employed further, then it should be possible to learn to interact with a wide variety of objects, and not only rigid objects. In this work, we use a combination of state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithms to solve the problem of manipulating deformable objects (specifically cloth). We evaluate our approach on three tasksâ€”folding a towel up to a mark, folding a face towel diagonally, and draping a piece of cloth over a hanger. Our agents are fully trained in simulation with domain randomisation, and then successfully deployed in the real world without having seen any real deformable objects.}

  abstract = { We consider the problem of autonomous robotic laundry folding, and propose a solution to the perception and manipulation challenges inherent to the task. At the core of our approach is a quasi-static cloth model which allows us to neglect the complex dynamics of cloth under significant parts of the state space, allowing us to reason instead in terms of simple geometry. We present an algorithm which, given a 2D cloth polygon and a desired sequence of folds, outputs a motion plan for executing the corresponding manipulations, deemed g-folds, on a minimal number of robot grippers. We define parametrized fold sequences for four clothing categories: towels, pants, short-sleeved shirts, and long-sleeved shirts, each represented as polygons. We then devise a model-based optimization approach for visually inferring the class and pose of a spread-out or folded clothing article from a single image, such that the resulting polygon provides a parse suitable for these folding primitives. We test the manipulation and perception tasks individually, and combine them to implement an autonomous folding system on the Willow Garage PR2. This enables the PR2 to identify a clothing article spread out on a table, execute the computed folding sequence, and visually track its progress over successive folds. }

We highlight the disadvantages of this method and present the median absolute deviation, an alternative and more robust measure of dispersion that is easy to implement.

@article{Verleysen2020-folding,
  abstract  = {Deformable objects such as ropes, wires, and clothing are omnipresent in society and industry but are little researched in robotics research. This is due to the infinite amount of possible state configurations caused by the deformations of the deformable object. Engineered approaches try to cope with this by implementing highly complex operations in order to estimate the state of the deformable object. This complexity can be circumvented by utilizing learning-based approaches, such as reinforcement learning, which can deal with the intrinsic high-dimensional state space of deformable objects. However, the reward function in reinforcement learning needs to measure the state configuration of the highly deformable object. Vision-based reward functions are difficult to implement, given the high dimensionality of the state and complex dynamic behavior. In this work, we propose the consideration of concepts beyond vision and incorporate other modalities which can be extracted from deformable objects. By integrating tactile sensor cells into a textile piece, proprioceptive capabilities are gained that are valuable as they provide a reward function to a reinforcement learning agent. We demonstrate on a low-cost dual robotic arm setup that a physical agent can learn on a single CPU core to fold a rectangular patch of textile in the real world based on a learned reward function from tactile information.},

Quite often, time series appear warped in time, i.e, although they may exhibit amplitude and shape similarity, they appear dephased in time. The most common algorithm to overcome this challenge is the Dynamic Time Warping, which aligns each sequence prior establishing distance measurements. However, Dynamic Time Warping takes only into account amplitude similarity. A distance which characterizes the degree of time warping between two sequences can deliver new insights for applications where the timing factor is essential, such well-defined movements during sports or rehabilitation exercises. We propose a novel measurement called Time Alignment Measurement, which delivers similarity information on the temporal domain. We demonstrate the potential of our approach in measuring performance of time series alignment methodologies and in the characterization of synthetic and real time series data acquired during human movement.}

  abstract = {Since 2006, deep learning (DL) has become a rapidly growing research direction, redefining state-of-the-art performances in a wide range of areas such as object recognition, image segmentation, speech recognition and machine translation. In modern manufacturing systems, data-driven machine health monitoring is gaining in popularity due to the widespread deployment of low-cost sensors and their connection to the Internet. Meanwhile, deep learning provides useful tools for processing and analyzing these big machinery data. The main purpose of this paper is to review and summarize the emerging research work of deep learning on machine health monitoring. After the brief introduction of deep learning techniques, the applications of deep learning in machine health monitoring systems are reviewed mainly from the following aspects: Auto-encoder (AE) and its variants, Restricted Boltzmann Machines and its variants including Deep Belief Network (DBN) and Deep Boltzmann Machines (DBM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). In addition, an experimental study on the performances of these approaches has been conducted, in which the data and code have been online. Finally, some new trends of DL-based machine health monitoring methods are discussed.}

  abstract = {Dataset size continues to increase and data are being collected from numerous applications. Because collecting labeled data is expensive and time consuming, the amount of unlabeled data is increasing. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has been proposed to improve conventional supervised learning methods by training from both unlabeled and labeled data. In contrast to classification problems, the estimation of labels for unlabeled data presents added uncertainty for regression problems. In this paper, a semi-supervised support vector regression (SS-SVR) method based on self-training is proposed. The proposed method addresses the uncertainty of the estimated labels for unlabeled data. To measure labeling uncertainty, the label distribution of the unlabeled data is estimated with two probabilistic local reconstruction (PLR) models. Then, the training data are generated by oversampling from the unlabeled data and their estimated label distribution. The sampling rate is different based on uncertainty. Finally, expected margin-based pattern selection (EMPS) is employed to reduce training complexity. We verify the proposed method with 30 regression datasets and a real-world problem: virtual metrology (VM) in semiconductor manufacturing. The experiment results show that the proposed method improves the accuracy by 8 compared with conventional supervised SVR, and the training time for the proposed method is 20 shorter than that of the benchmark methods.}

  abstract = {In this paper, a novel robust Bayesian network is proposed for process modeling with low-quality data. Since unreliable data can cause model parameters to deviate from the real distributions and make network structures unable to characterize the true causalities, data quality feature is utilized to improve the process modeling and monitoring performance. With a predetermined trustworthy center, the data quality measurement results can be evaluated through an exponential function with Mahalanobis distances. The conventional Bayesian network learning algorithms including structure learning and parameter learning are modified by the quality feature in a weighting form, intending to extract useful information and make a reasonable model. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through TE benchmark process and a real industrial process.}

More specifically, we discuss how this information can be cast into socially-inspired rewards for speeding up the policy optimisation for both efficient task completion and user adaptation in an online learning setting. For this purpose a potential-based reward shaping method is combined with a sample efficient reinforcement learning algorithm to offer a principled framework to cope with these potentially noisy interim rewards. The proposed scheme will greatly facilitate the system's development by allowing the designer to teach his system through explicit positive/negative feedbacks given as hints about task progress, in the early stage of training. At a later stage, the approach will be used as a way to ease the adaptation of the dialogue policy to specific user profiles. Experiments carried out using a state-of-the-art goal-oriented dialogue management framework, the Hidden Information State (HIS), support our claims in two configurations: firstly, with a user simulator in the tourist information domain (and thus simulated appraisals), and secondly, in the context of manâ€“robot dialogue with real user trials.}
