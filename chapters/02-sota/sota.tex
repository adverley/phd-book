\chapter{Background and review of related work} \label{ch:lit}

The goal of the following chapter is to provide the preliminaries and a review of relevant work in the field of robotic manipulation of deformable objects. To provide some historical context, we first discuss how \emph{standard robotic manipulation pipelines} can be used for manipulating deformable objects in Section~\ref{sec:lit_traditional}. Next, in Section~\ref{sec:lit_learning} we introduce how the inherent limitations of engineered motor control architectures can be overcome by using \emph{learning-based methods}. We break this section down into subsections introducing supervised learning, deep neural networks and reinforcement learning. This is followed by surveying their applications in recent robotic manipulation work. Given the general property that learning-based methods are data-hungry, we continue this discussion by reviewing the role of \emph{large datasets} for robotic learning in Section~\ref{sec:lit_datasets}. An alternative approach to generating data is to use synthetic data. To this end, we discuss the role of \emph{simulation} and the corresponding transferability problems in Section~\ref{sec:lit_simulation}. Critical to robotic learning of manipulation skills is some metric of task success, generally labelled as reward function. The role and methods to obtain \emph{reward functions} for robotic learning, and deformable objects manipulation in particular, is reviewed in Section~\ref{sec:lit_reward_learning}. Finally, we discuss the idea and corresponding literature of \emph{instrumenting the process with sensors} to facilitate the learning process in the manipulation environment in Section~\ref{sec:lit_instrumentation}.


\section{Manipulating deformable objects} \label{sec:lit_traditional}
% TODO: mogelijks is dit hoofdstuk zo groot geworden dat het kan helpen om subsecties te introduceren. Ik denk ook om de opbouw 1D -> 2D + robotic folding -> 3D te veranderen naar: 1D -> 2d -> 3D -> robotic folding -> conclusion
% traditionele pipelines, algemeen en bondig. 

Grasping and manipulation problems in robotics are traditionally solved by manually engineering subsystems for perception, planning and control~\autocite{Siciliano2008}. A general approach is to use images as input observation for controlling the motions of the robot. This is motivated by the advantage that images enable closed-loop control: non-contact and real-time measurements of the environment can be used to provide feedback to the motion trajectory of the robot. This principle is generally known as visual servoing~\autocite{Hutchinson1996} and was first introduced by~\citeauthor{Hill1979} in~\citeyear{Hill1979}. An archetypical pipeline consists of the following steps to grasp and manipulate an object~\autocite{Corke1996}. First, observations such as images are used to estimate the state of the object. This state estimation stage usually executes pixel manipulations and image filtering in order to extract features. This object state is in turn used for interpreting the scene in order to calculate the relative position of the target object from the robot end-effector. Once the object is identified, it can be modelled such that a suitable grasping point can be identified. Next, these grasping points are given to a motion planning system that estimates a trajectory to move the end-effector to the desired position and orientation. Finally, a low-level controller sends motor commands to the actuators to move the robot.
% TODO: add figure of some typical modular pipeline


% Probleem met traditionele pipelines toepassen voor vervormbare objecten
Engineering modular, hand-tuned motor control pipelines have been successful for applications in manufacturing~\autocite{Clocksin1985,Mochizuki1987}, car steering~\autocite{Dickmanns1988}, robotic ping-pong~\autocite{Andersson1987}, juggling~\autocite{Rizzi1993} as well as fruit picking~\autocite{Harrell1989}. However, all of these applications operate under the condition of rigid objects: the shape of the object will not change on contact. When manipulating objects, this is of importance for determining stable grasping points. More concretely, restraining rigid objects relies on \textit{form closure}~\autocite{Nguyen1988} or \textit{force closure}~\autocite{Bicchi1995}: fully constraining relative motion of the object or having contact points that can counteract an external wrench through friction. % TODO optional: foto toevoegen: form closure: portefuille volledig vastgrijpen (zie robotics springer bible pagina 1023, fig 38.6 en fig 38.8)
In the case of deformable objects, the object can deform during grasping and manipulation. This leads to exponentially higher dimensional configuration spaces~\autocite{Foresti2004} compared to rigid object manipulation. For example, achieving form closure becomes impossible as it requires immobilizing every degree of freedom. Similarly, force closure becomes computationally intractable as it requires constantly incorporating the adapted shape of the object. Furthermore, manipulation requires reasoning about the target shape of the object. These properties make the vast amount of research done in the rigid object manipulation domain inapplicable for the deformable object domain. Unfortunately, to date, the vast majority of robotic manipulation work deals with rigid objects whereas many objects are of deformable nature~\autocite{Siciliano2008}.

% Vervormbare objecten: wat zijn ze, categorisatie, welke taken en welke oude pipelines bestaan er
A deformable object is generally understood as an object whose shape changes when being subject to an external force. This deformation can be temporary and reversible (\textit{elastic}), permanent (\textit{plastic}) or a combination of both (\textit{elasto-plastic}). Deformable objects are found both in industrial settings and household items. A common categorization~\autocite{Saadat2002,Jimenez2012} is based on the geometry of the object: how many dimensions are prevalent over the other dimensions. In its simplest setting, the deformable object is one dimensional: ropes, strings, cables, threads and catheters among others. These objects are also known as deformable linear objects. The term \textit{linear} refers to one dimension being dominant over the other two dimensions. Common tasks for deformable linear objects are grasping, manipulation, sensing and knot tying. Early motor control architectures for solving tasks regarding deformable linear objects used either an open-loop approach or simple visual servoing to execute the motion. An early work demonstrating modular motor control pipelines clearly is the project of~\citeauthor{Inaba1987} in~\citeyear{Inaba1987}. In their work, they use visual servoing for manipulating a rope into a ring and then tying the rope. Their perception module uses stereo images to detect the rope and the ring. The planning module is hard-coded to iterate through a set of predefined steps while using the detected center of the ring and 3D coordinates of the endpoints of the rope from the perception module. An inverse kinematics module provides a target trajectory to the low-level controller. Similar modular pipelines can be found in~\autocite{Remde1999} for grasping a rope and in~\autocite{Saha2007} where knots are tied with needles using probabilistic trajectories of the rope from a simulated model. Incorporating motion primitives, i.e. a predefined set of motor actions corresponding to high-level actions, in the planning module is used in~\autocite{Yamakawa2008, Vinh2012} to tie knots in a rope.

% 2D objects klassieke pipelines
Deformable \textit{linear} objects become deformable \textit{planar} objects when two dimensions are significantly larger than the third dimension. In this case, the planning module can disregard the thickness of the material for manipulation. Canonical examples of such objects are clothing, thin-shelled objects like plastic bottles, fabric, paper, paper and plastic bags, deformable sheets, cards and foam materials. In context of this thesis, it is of interest to note that clothing satisfy the same geometrical property of this classification as other objects such as paper and plastic bottles. However, the main characteristic distinguishing clothing is the compression strength: clothing compared to other two-dimensional deformable objects do not possess any significant compression strength. Given that the current work deals with manipulations of clothing, we focus in particular on cloth folding pipelines.

% Cloth folding pipelines (houvast = Sanchez2018, Matas, Douman2016)
It is possible to distinguish multiple task when considering cloth manipulation applications: sensing, grasping, manipulation and cloth-specific tasks such as folding, cloth hanging and bedsheet folding. A complete cloth folding pipeline typically consists of the following subtasks: (1) grasping an isolated garment, (2) bringing it into a folded configuration and (3) stacking it on top of other folded garments. The second step in this process is often subdivided into unfolding, flattening and folding. Most of the work in robotic folding deal with a subtask instead of the complete pipeline. A notable exception to this are the pipelines of~\textcite{Doumanoglou2016,Maitin2010} that consider the whole robotic folding pipeline.

The easiest solution for cloth folding is to use specialized hardware in a constrained environment.~\Textcite{Nair2013} propose an actuated flipfold\footnote{A flipfold is a device consisting of four panels joined by hinges. The fout panels lineup with the two sleeves topcenter and topbottom of the shirt respectively. The hinges allow the panels to individually fold to the center panel.} that automates folding of shirts. More complex commercially available products exists such as the FoldiMate\footnote{\url{https://foldimate.com/}}. However, such products do not generalize towards general cloth folding, do not leverage general-purpose robotic hardware and have proven difficult to bring commercially available\footnote{FoldiMate has been in prototype development for nine years at time of writing.}. This is why most research consider the use of general-purpose robot arms, possibly with dedicated gripper and instrumentation, as elaborated in Section~\ref{sec:lit_instrumentation}.

%  Maar wat is het doel van deze subsectie?  = Inzicht verschaffen in hoe "klassieke" pipelines het probleem opdelen (is al geschreven :)) en hoe ze die problemen typisch aanpakken. Doel is dat lezer hieruit kan afleiden dat dat wel cool is maar: traag, error accumulation, geen knowledge reuse etc. 

% 3D objects klassieke pipelines
The final category of deformable objects are \textit{solid deformable objects} whose deformations across all dimensions of the object are of relevance. These are objects such as food, plush toys and sponges. In general, 3D deformable objects are the least researched type of deformable objects~\autocite{Sanchez2018}. An exception to this is soft tissue which is of importance for medical application. We refer the reader to the review paper by~\textcite{Taylor2016} for an overview of medical robots in surgery applications. For an overview on robotic manipulation of food products, we refer to the survey by~\textcite{Chua2003}.

% Convergeren naar het besluit: al deze pipelines, gaande van 1D naar 3D deformable objects share a common divide-and-conquer approach which lead to a plethora of problems (zie lijst hierboven). Voeg ook dingen toe van FWO voorstel p10 en geef opening voor smart controllers. 

Ultimately, the motor control architectures discussed in this section suffer ...


% Dit hoort volgens mij eerder thuis in introductie:
%For example, a recent cloth folding pipeline by~\citeauthor{Doumanoglou2016} starts with a visual perception to detect candidate grasp points. These grasp points are then given to a planning module to move the robot end-effector to the desired position and orientation. This divide-and-conquer methodology leads to a loss of information between the different stages, resulting in the accumulation of errors. \Citeauthor{Doumanoglou2016} report difficulties when folding towels because the perception system labels them as shirts. These individual components are built in a laboratory environment with certain assumptions which are likely to be violated in an unstructured, complex environment. Inaccurate sensor readings together with deformation of the robot’s links also deteriorate the accuracy of these systems. In contrast, modern deep learning approaches try to achieve the same outcome in an end-to-end fashion. This is done by
