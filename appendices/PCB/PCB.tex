\section{Separate Detector and Laser Driver Board Designs}

  This design is the first prototype. Three different board have been designed. This way, it is easier to test and debug each of the circuits separately. If need be, a single board can be replaced, reducing the cost to replace a circuit if it does not function as intended.


\section{Combined Detector and Laser Driver Board Design with PIC-tail Connector}

  This board combines both the laser driver circuit and detector into a single board. This makes the interconnections simpler but offers less debugging capabilities. Test-pins have been added to the circuit to more easily test the different circuits. Additionally, the board also features a PIC-tail vertical connector. This allows to plug the board into the Explorer~16 development board.t
