\keyInText{\emph{Our research focuses on reducing the required learning data for systems that perceive and manipulate clothing items}. We implement a cloth simulation method to generate synthetic data, utilize smart textiles for state estimation of cloth, crowdsource a dataset of people folding clothing, and propose a method to estimate how well people are folding clothing without providing labels.}
\setlaymanexpl{We provide the preliminaries and a review of relevant work in the field of robotic manipulation of deformable objects.}
