- Updated contributions in ch1: our paper on learning reward functions is accepted and to be published in Springer APIN.
- Fix typos across chapters.
- Fixed wrong colour references in Chapter 3, Figure 3.5
- ch3: fully specified how the size of action and state space is calculated
- Fixed all typos reported by Prof. Derammelaere
- ch6: better explain how the reward function is extracted from the alignment embeddings (i.e. explain the ambiguous phrase "cost of best fit")
- Fixed Verlet integration equation as reported by Prof. Simoens
- Fixed the list of typos reported by Prof. Simoens


TODO:
- appendix A now includes a table containing additional training parameters: weights of reward function (and how it was tuned), learning rate, neural network architecture 
- appended future work to include future experiments and necessary components to integrate all modules of this work into an integrated robot cloth folding system 
-
